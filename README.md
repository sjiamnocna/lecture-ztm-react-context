# react-context-lesson
This is my implementation history of [Context-lesson](https://github.com/ZhangMYihua/react-context-lesson) from [Zero to Master academy](https://zerotomastery.io/)  course [Complete React Developer in 2021 (w/ Redux, Hooks, GraphQL)](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/)

## The course is really worth
While doing this (and any other) course it's extremely important to
1. try doing own projects
2. verify information using other sources
3. give feedback and suggestions for improvement
